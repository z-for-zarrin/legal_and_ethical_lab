# Legal and Ethical Standards
### Friday Week 7 Lab

## Scenario 1 - BankingCorp

**Legal concerns:**

* 	While banks are free to give this data to other financial institutions, since the payday loan company are not directly servicing loans made through the bank, customers must legally be given the choice to opt out of having any non-public information shared.

**Ethical concerns:**

*	Targeting of customers based on financial history could be considered predatory.
* 	The negative publicity the loan company have been receiving recently could be related to unethical business practices.
* 	Obfuscating the fact that personal information is being shared with a loan company could lead to lack of informed consent.

**Next steps:**

* 	Make all customers, existing and new, fully aware of the partnership and what it means for their data, so they can choose to opt-out of having it shared. Inform existing customers before the partnership goes ahead to give them time to submit an opt-out request.
* 	Carry out thorough checks to make sure the loan company abides by all ethical values held by BankingCorp.

## Scenario 2 - Treasure Hunters

**Legal concerns:**

*	The mechanic of buying hints is not a form of gambling.
* 	There is currently no specific legislation in the UK that prohibits or restricts microtransactions in games.

**Ethical concerns:**

*	Players having access more levels in a day will keep them on the app longer. This could lead to addictive or compulsive playing habits which in turn cause players to spend more money to get through more levels.
* 	Many mobile games with these in-app purchases are known to target children, preying on their relative lack of financial sense and hoping they spend their parents' money.

**Next steps:**

*	Implementing limits on how much real-world money a player can spend within a day.
* 	Make sure paying for hints with points is a viable option that is open to any player with an average score.
*  Find other ways to monetise the game that don't require player to pay, such as showing adverts. Show skippable adverts between levels or allow players to choose to watch a whole 30 second one to earn a hint every hour or so. While these may decrease the quality of the user experience somewhat, they are a staple of mobile gaming that most casual players have gotten used to.
