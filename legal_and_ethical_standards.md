# Legal and Ethical Standards
### Friday Week 7 Lab

## Scenario 1 - BankingCorp

**Legal concerns:**

* 	While banks are free to give this data to other financial institutions, since the payday loan company are not directly servicing loans made through the bank, customers must legally be given the choice to opt out of having any non-public information shared.

**Ethical concerns:**

*	Targeting of customers based on financial history could be considered predatory.
* 	The negative publicity the loan company have been receiving recently could be related to unethical business practices.
* 	Obfuscating the fact that personal information is being shared with a loan company could lead to lack of informed consent.

**Next steps:**

* 	Make all customers, existing and new, fully aware of the partnership and what it means for their data, so they can choose to opt-out of having their data shared.
* 	Carry out thorough checks to make sure the loan company abides by all ethical values held by BankingCorp.
